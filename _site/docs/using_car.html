<p>By default AirSim prompts user for which vehicle to use. You can easily change this by setting <a href="settings.md#SimMode">SimMode</a>. For example, if you want to use car instead then just set the SimMode in your <a href="settings.md">settings.json</a> which you can find in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Documents/AirSim</code> folder, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "SettingsVersion": 1.2,
  "SimMode": "Car"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you restart AirSim, you should see the car spawned automatically.</p>

<h2 id="manual-driving">Manual Driving</h2>
<p>Please use the keyboard arrow keys to drive manually. Spacebar for the handbrake. In manual drive mode, gears are set in “auto”.</p>

<h2 id="using-apis">Using APIs</h2>
<p>You can control the car, get state and images by calling APIs in variety of client languages including C++ and Python. Please see <a href="apis.md">APIs doc</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="changing-views">Changing Views</h2>
<p>By default camera will chase the car from the back. You can get the FPV view by pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> key and switch back to chasing from back view by pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> key. More keyboard shortcuts can be seen by pressing F1.</p>

<h2 id="cameras">Cameras</h2>
<p>By default car is installed with 5 cameras: center, left and right, driver and reverse. You can chose the images from these camera by specifying <a href="image_apis.md#available_cameras">the name</a>.</p>
