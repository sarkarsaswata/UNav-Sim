<p>To use Logitech G920 steering wheel with AirSim follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Connect the steering wheel to the computer and wait until drivers installation complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install Logitech Gaming Software from <a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/lgs">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before debug, you’ll have to normalize the values in AirSim code. Perform this changes in CarPawn.cpp (according to the current update in the git):<br />
  In line 382, change “Val” to “1 – Val”. (the complementary value in the range [0.0,1.0]).<br />
  In line 388, change “Val” to “5Val - 2.5” (Change the range of the given input from [0.0,1.0] to [-1.0,1.0]).<br />
  In line 404, change “Val” to “4(1 – Val)”. (the complementary value in the range [0.0,1.0]).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debug AirSim project (while the steering wheel is connected – it’s important).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Unreal Editor, go to Edit-&gt;plugins-&gt;input devices and enable “Windows RawInput”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Raw Input, and add new device configuration:<br />
  Vendor ID: 0x046d (In case of Logitech G920, otherwise you might need to check it).<br />
  Product ID: 0xc261 (In case of Logitech G920, otherwise you might need to check it).<br />
  Under “Axis Properties”, make sure that “GenericUSBController Axis 2”, “GenericUSBController Axis 4” and “GenericUSBController Axis 5” are all enabled with an offset of 1.0.<br />
  Explanation: axis 2 is responsible for steering movement, axis 4 is for brake and axis 5 is for gas. If you need to configure the clutch, it’s on axis 3.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Input, Under Bindings in “Axis Mappings”:<br />
  Remove existing mappings from the groups “MoveRight” and “MoveForward”.<br />
  Add new axis mapping to the group “MoveRight”, use GenericUSBController axis 2 with a scale of 1.0.<br />
  Add new axis mapping to the group “MoveForward”, use GenericUSBController axis 5 with a scale of 1.0.<br />
  Add a new group of axis mappings, name it “FootBrake” and add new axis mapping to this group, use GenericUSBController axis 4 with a scale of 1.0.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Play and drive !</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pay-attention">Pay Attention</h3>

<p>Notice that in the first time we “play” after debug, we need to touch the wheel to “reset” the values.</p>

<h3 id="tip">Tip</h3>

<p>In the gaming software, you can configure buttons as keyboard shortcuts, we used it to configure a shortcut to record dataset or to play in full screen.</p>
