<p>Moved here from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/wiki/An-Orbit-Trajectory">https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/wiki/An-Orbit-Trajectory</a></p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to fly a nice smooth circular orbit? This can be handy for capturing 3D objects from all sides especially if you get multiple orbits at different altitudes.</p>

<p>So the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PythonClient/multirotor</code> folder contains a script named <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/main/PythonClient/multirotor/orbit.py">Orbit</a> that will do precisely that.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://youtu.be/RFG5CTQi3Us">demo video</a></p>

<p>The demo video was created by running this command line:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python orbit.py <span class="nt">--radius</span> 10 <span class="nt">--altitude</span> 5 <span class="nt">--speed</span> 1 <span class="nt">--center</span> <span class="s2">"0,1"</span> <span class="nt">--iterations</span> 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This flies a 10 meter radius orbit around the center location at (startpos + radius * [0,1]), in other words, the center is located <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">radius</code> meters away in the direction of the provided center vector.  It also keeps the front-facing camera on the drone always pointing at the center of the circle. If you watch the flight using LogViewer you will see a nice circular pattern get traced out on the GPS map:</p>

<p>The core of the algorithm is not that complicated.  At each point on the circle, we look ahead by a small delta in degrees, called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lookahead_angle</code>, where that angle is computed based on our desired velocity.  We then find that lookahead point on the circle using sin/cosine and make that our “target point”. Calculating the velocity then is easy, just subtract our current position from that point and feed that into the AirSim method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveByVelocityZ</code>.</p>
